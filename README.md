# cratedb_easier
making cratedb easier by allowing you to execute the queries as a normal text string. It will formulate the formatted string and will execute the query and will allow for the selection of the data. Attending the cradedb meeting, so thought of wirting this piece of code. Thank you cratedb.

This will be ready by evening and you can directly deploy the cratedb without any programming knowledge or using the SQL. Let me know and will integrate the complete SQL guide autocompletion.
